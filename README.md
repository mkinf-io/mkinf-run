# Welcome to mkinf!

We are developing a curated library of production-ready tools and agents designed to streamline AI development. This library empowers developers to build, customize, and deploy AI-powered solutions with minimal effort while maintaining full flexibility.

**Production-Ready:** Everything here is built to perform in production environments. Our platform is backed by a distributed network of data centers.

**Customizable:** Fork and customize tools you like to suit your needs and deploy on our platform

**Community Effort:** We’re constantly updating and adding new tools based on what developers need most. Got a great idea or improvement? Jump in and contribute — it’s all about building together. If your project is closed source you can still list it on our library and monetize from usage.

**Plug and Play:** Built to integrate effortlessly into any framework or pipeline, our library reduces the time and complexity required to get AI agents up and running in production.

## Why we are building this

Building AI agents can be a pain. The ecosystem is scattered, development takes forever, and infrastructure is a whole other nightmare. We’re fixing that.

With this library, you’ll:
- Access a curated collection of ready-to-go tools and agents.
- Slash your dev time with battle-tested solutions.
- Spend more time innovating and less time wrangling infrastructure.

## Join the Community
We’re just getting started, and we’d love for you to join us. Whether you’re here to use the library, contribute your own tools, or just share feedback, welcome aboard. Let’s make building with AI simpler, faster, and way more fun.
